This ChangeLog documents changes prior to when this plugin was merged into the
Plugin Pack.  See the ChangeLog file a directory up for post-merge changes.

version 1.4
	* Eliminate strictly identical duplicates from the viewer.  This is
	  useful when a contact has multiple accounts and uses Gaim's global
	  buddy icon selector to set the same icon across accounts.  However,
	  some duplicates still appear when the file formats are different
	  (for example, if one account has a .png icon and another is .jpg).

version 1.3
	* Update to build properly with 2.0.0beta4 on win32

version 1.2
	* Update the album window from an idle loop, so Gaim doesn't hang
	  when you have lots of icons for a buddy
	* Update release for Gaim 2.0.0
	  Things will still build on Gaim 1.x.y, but the Windows DLL shipped
	  with this version only works on Gaim 2.0.0.  Likewise, the RPM .spec
	  file is designed for Gaim 2.  If you need to build an RPM for Gaim 1,
	  use the .spec file from the Gaim Album 1.1 release.

version 1.1
	* Fixed a fatal bug in caching of icons that exist when the plugin
	  first loads.  This feature should actually work now. :)
	* Fixed a fatal bug in the Windows build.  The archive will actually
	  include a .dll now. Oops!

version 1.0
	* Initial Release
