The Purple Plugin Pack was originally created by Gary Kramlich and Stu
Tomlinson as a way to distribute their ever growing lists of simple Pidgin
plugins. It has since grown from its origins of about 6 plugins to nearly 50.

Also, many more developers have continued to add to it, including John Bailey,
Peter Lawler, Sadrul Habib Chowdhury, and most recently Richard Laager.
