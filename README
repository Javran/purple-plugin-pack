The modules are:
 *************************************************************************
 * Buddy Edit Module

 * control on the conversation screen on a per-contact basis.

 * displayed in the conversation screen as well as the hover tooltip.
 *************************************************************************
 * Buddy Timezone Module

 * basis so it can display the localtime of your contact when a conversation
 * starts. Convenient if you deal with contacts from many parts of the
 * world.

COMPILATION:

To build them, just unpack this package and run "make && make install". You
will need the gaim header files, which for major distributions are shipped
in the gaim-dev package. For the spelling control module you will also need
gtkspell-dev and gtk2-dev.

This will install the module in ~/.gaim/plugins and they will be available
next time you start Gaim.

There are three options you can control in the compilation phase:

- PRIVATE_TZLIB=yes/no

If yes, a priviate timezone library will be used which is more efficient and
cleaner in implementation, but does duplicate some system functionality.

- CUSTOM_GTK=yes/no

If yes, the timezone plugin will include a custom GTK widget for timezone
selection. While this widget is easier to use, it does make the plugin
depend on gtk. If you select no it will only use standard Gaim components.
Note, the custom GTK widget only works with Gaim2.

- GAIM_NAME=gaim

If you have multiple versions of Gaim installed you can use this variable to
select which version to compile against. It should correspond to the name
used in the .pc file. It also changes the install directory.
