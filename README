All the files in this package are licenced under the GNU General Public
Licence version 2, with the exception of the files:

localtime.c
tzfile.h
private.h

These files, although modified, were copied from the Olson Timezone code
(http://www.twinsun.com/tz/tz-link.htm) and remain under the public domain.

The modules are:
 *************************************************************************
 * Buddy Edit Module
 *
 * A GAIM plugin that adds an edit to to buddies allowing you to change
 * various details you can't normally change. It also provides a mechanism
 * for subsequent plugins to add themselves to that dialog.
 *************************************************************************
 * Buddy Language Module
 *
 * A GAIM plugin that allows you to configure the language of the spelling
 * control on the conversation screen on a per-contact basis.
 *************************************************************************
 * Buddy Notes Module
 *
 * A GAIM plugin the allows you to add notes to contacts which will be
 * displayed in the conversation screen as well as the hover tooltip.
 *************************************************************************
 * Buddy Timezone Module
 *
 * A GAIM plugin that allows you to configure a timezone on a per-contact
 * basis so it can display the localtime of your contact when a conversation
 * starts. Convenient if you deal with contacts from many parts of the
 * world.
 *************************************************************************

To build them, just unpack this package and run "make && make install". You
will need the gaim header files, which for major distributions are shipped
in the gaim-dev package. For the spelling control module you will also need
gtkspell-dev and gtk2-dev.

This will install the module in ~/.gaim/plugins and they will be available
next time you start GAIM.
