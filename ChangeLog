Version 2.6.4: ??/??/??
	* Added German translation (see AUTHORS for credits).
	* Fix a use-after-free in IRC Helper.
	* IRC Helper delays autojoins until after identifying with Purple 2.7.0 or
	  newer.
	* Support new Freenode IDENTIFY syntax in IRC Helper so users can log into
	  services even when using an alternate or new nick.
	* IRC Helper now properly supports and suppresses new Freenode welcome and
	  identified messages.

Version 2.6.3: 03/28/10
	* Add support for Spidernet to IRC Helper plugin.
	* IRC Helper now supports suppressing messages from the Freenode bot
	  frigg.
	* IRC-More now builds when you pass --with-plugins=irc-more to configure.
	  (Ivan Ponomarev)
	* IRC-More no longer tries to set umodes on connect if none are specified.
	* IRC-More now provides a channel autojoin list.  Autojoins happen with a
	  6-second delay to allow IRC Helper to do its job first.

Version 2.6.2: 01/01/10
	* Fix IRC More plugin not properly rejoining channels.
	* IRC More no longer has a preference for auto rejoin delay--default to
	  100 milliseconds.
	* Splitter plugin now connects to signals with
	  PURPLE_SIGNAL_PRIORITY_HIGHEST, which makes it process messages last.
	* Splitter will not touch any messages generated by the OTR plugin,
	  resolving compatibility issues.
	* Splitter now resubmits split messages through the normal message
	  handling mechanisms in libpurple and tracks those resubmissions, meaning
	  splitting of messages will no longer bypass any other plugins
	  intercepting outgoing messages.
	* /exec's author list no longer makes the Pidgin plugins dialog wider.
	* Talkfilters is no longer a dependency of itself, allowing the plugin to
	  build. (pva)

Version 2.6.1: 12/07/09
	* Add support for limiting the number of bytes of history displayed by
	  the Enhanced History plugin.
	* Add a preference to the Google plugin to allow users to specify a
	  Google domain to use.  For example, www.google.com or www.google.fr.
	* Fix the "Set User Modes On Connect" and "Unset User Modes On Connect"
	  settings provided by irc-more on IRC accounts.
	* Fix Message Splitter so that it builds on Windows.
	* Fix Group Message so that its request dialog doesn't get too long.
	* Make IRC Helper suppress an additional message related to hostmasks.
	  (John Dennis)
	* Fix the Colorize plugin to be UTF-8 compliant.

Version 2.6.0: 08/30/09
	* Fix grouping of radio buttons in switchspell menu for enchant-enabled
	  GtkSpell.  This has the side effect of eliminating slow tab switching
	  and multiple language switches during menu drawing.  (Basil Gor)
	* Fixed a NULL deref crash in the slashexec plugin when processing a
	  chat room message.
	* Added XMPP Priority plugin.  This allows users to configure the
	  priority attribute for XMPP statuses on a per-account basis.
	* Added the "abusive" stress plugin.  This is a protocol plugin intended
	  for use in stressing libpurple and any plugins using libpurple's
	  facilities.  This plugin is still experimental and will almost certainly
	  cause some problems, so use with caution and do NOT use with your usual
	  .purple directory!

Version 2.5.1: 12/25/08
	* Really fixed switch spell now...

Version 2.5.0: 12/20/08
	* Fixed some crashes in autprofile related to old preference paths
	  (amishmm)
	* ListHandler now handles "FriendlyName" lines in .blt files generated by
	  newer Windows AIM versions when importing.
	* Added Vietnamese translation - thanks Nguyen Huu Phuoc 
	* findip and groupmsg are now default plugins.
	* Added nomobility plugin (does not yet work, doesn't build by default)
	* Fixed --with-plugins (yet again...)
	* Support dependency scenarios where dependency A OR dependency B is the
	  correct solution.  This fixes dependencies for switchspell, which can
	  use GTKSpell with either the Enchant backend or the aspell backend.
	  Let us know if you still have trouble building switchspell but have
	  the correct development packages installed.

Version 2.4.0: 08/03/08
	* Rewrote the build system to make our lifes easier, as well as support
	  the requirements of some plugins.  This has added a dependency on
	  python.
	* Removed 'menuconfig' since the new build system should be extending
	  to support it's behavior instead.
	* Merged the Autoprofile plugin into our build system.
	* Fixed convbadger's failure to update on conversation switch.
	* Added Ike Gingerich's colorize plugin
	* Added Ike Gingerich's splitter plugin
	* Fixed dewysiwygification's debug messages not properly ending lines.
	* Added Google plugin for "I'm Feeling Lucky" searches.
	* Fixed aspell dependency in switchspell (fixes gentoo bug #196693)
	* Made switchspell work with gtkspell that uses enchant; this behavior is
	  now the default.  To use gtkspell using aspell, use the
	  --disable-enchant argument to ./configure.
	* Added preferences to the irssi plugin that allow changing its behavior
	* Fixed the preference strings in slashexec so mnemonics are no longer
	  incorrectly interpreted from the strings.
	* Added Message Length plugin (short name: msglen).
	* Added Chat User List Logging plugin (short name: listlog).
	* The Enhanced History plugin is now contact-aware.
	* Slashexec now strips ASCII control characters.  Fixes, among others,
	  bug #452, where commands can cause XMPP disconnection.  May cause some
	  characters to be sent that are part of escape sequences.

Version 2.3.0: 03/17/08
	* Fixed a typo in irc-more's source that allowed a potential double-free
	* Fixed unregistering commands when unloading gRIM and Magic 8 ball plugin
	* Fixed napster plugin.  It builds cleanly and loads properly now.
	* Added /bollocks command to Magic 8 ball plugin inspired by (and ported
	  from) /dev/bollocks kernel module
	* Added Andrew Pangborn's Enhanced History plugin and ported it to the
	  Pidgin and libpurple APIs.  Cleaned up some preferences as well.
	* Dice plugin now supports dice notation
	  (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice_notation), but it's not perfect yet.
	  (Lucas Paul)
	* Dice plugin now calls the /me command with its output.
	* Irc-more plugin adds notice support only when built against libpurple
	  older than 2.4.0.
	* Napster plugin now builds by default.
	* Removed the broadcast plugin.
	* Memory leak fixes
	* Fixed the --with-plugins configure argument.  It now correctly handles
	  all, default, and a comma separated list of plugins.

	  to the conversation window in 2.4.0.
	* Fixed a missing header include in the timelog plugin which caused a
	  plugin load failure under some circumstances.

	* Fixed autoreply so it doesn't reply with an empty message (rageboy04)
	* Fixed a crash in ignore where a nickname that is not all lowercase
	  causes unintended behavior resulting in a crash (rageboy04, qwert)
	* Fixed a possible double-free crash in /notice support in irc-more.
	* Fixed a crash in Slashexec that has only shown itself when using the
	  Offline Message Emulation plugin to emulate an offline message at the
	  same time as Slashexec is loaded.
	* Fixed the version number for highlight and ignore so they show the
	  correct Plugin Pack version instead of the version of Pidgin they were
	  built against.
	* Fixed building with ancient glib. (Bodo Bellut)
	* Removed the .build file from hideconv to remove it from default
	  builds.  Pidgin will have persistent conversations soon.

	  existing (incomplete) buddytime plugin

	* Listhandler now supports restoring a buddy list from a backed-up
	  blist.xml file created by backing up ~/.purple.
	* Merged autorejoin into irc-more.  No prefs migration will take place.
	  You will need to reconfigure the delay yourself.  Autorejoin no longer
	  exists.
	* Slashexec's '/exec command' and '!command' are now optional (QuLogic)
