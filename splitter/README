Message Splitter Plugin v0.95
Ike Gingerich <ike_@users.sourceforge.net>


------------
INTRODUCTION
------------

This is a simple plugin to split up outgoing messages that are larger
than a specified threshold in characters.


--------
FEATURES
--------

 - The split size and delay between messages are configurable from the
   plugin preferences menu.
 - Splits yield valid and balanced HTML taking into account tags that may
   have been opened or closed outside the split itself.
 - Splitting is done using Pango to split the message as appropriate 
   according to the current locale.


----
TODO
----

 - fix conflicts with plugins like Slashexec that don't expect to be 
   supplied an empty message during the 'sending-im' signal.
 - fix bug with characters disappearing when splitting heavily marked-up 
   lines.
 - find any remaining bugs and memory leaks.

INSTALLATION
------------

 - *NIX users:
	$ make install

	If you have build problems make sure you have the 
	appropriate pidgin-dev and build-essential files
	installed.

	Alternately you can copy spliter.c to
	(unzipped-source)/pidgin/plugins and
	after building Pidgin:

	$ make splitter.so

	then copy splitter.so to ~/.purple/plugins/ and launch Pidgin.


 - Windows users:
	I try to keep a pre-built current version of the plugin here:
	<http://ikebo.hypermart.net/splitter/splitter-current.dll> and
	on the Sourceforge message splitter plugin tracker.

	Otherwise you must compile it manually with Cygwin:

	        copy splitter.c to the plugin directory where the Pidgin
		source code is extracted to and type:

		$ make -f Makefile.mingw splitter.dll

	and copy splitter.dll to your plugin directory
	(e.x. C:\Program Files\Pidgin\plugins)
