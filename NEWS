1.0beta (12/16/05):
	John:  Well, this is our first release of the Plugin Pack.  Some of the
	plugins are useful, some are pointless, and some are for annoying buddies.
	We've put a lot of work into some of these plugins, and just banged out
	some of them in a quick hacking session, but we hope everyone enjoys the
	package, regardless of how much work went into your favorite plugin.
	On a semi-related note, happy birthday Peter!

	Gary: Here is the fabled plugin pack.  Fabled because it's been in
	development forever, and we've finally got it to a maintainable state.  So
	we hope you enjoy all of these plugins, since we couldn't justify packaging
	them separately.

    Peter: Are we using tabs or spaces at the start of each line here?
    Oh, Tabs it is then. And it's the 17th here, which is my birthday, not the
	16th. Why's r0bby not out on the street? Is this file unicode safe? â†‘?
    So I expect more pressies tomorrow your time. Already have new coffee tool,
	so send more coffee.

	Stu: I'm still here. Some of my pathetic plugins are too!
