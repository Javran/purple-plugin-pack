PURPOSE

This plugin was developed to enhance the usability of the IRC protocol in
Pidgin.  See the PHILOSOPHY file for more details.


COMPATIBILITY

This plugin is designed for Pidgin 2.0.0 and later.  It's developed as a plugin
for libpurple, so it should work in other libpurple-based clients such as Finch
and even Adium, but this has not been tested.

NOTE: This plugin may not compile with old versions of GTK+ or glib.
If that's important to you, please file a feature request with a copy of the
compiler errors you get when attempting to build the plugin.

This plugin has (at some point) been tested on the following networks:
	DALnet
	FreeNode
	GameSurge
	Jeux (by BNI on irc.freenode.net)
	QuakeNet
	SlashNET (by uilleann@users.sf.net)
	Undernet

If it doesn't work on these networks, please file that as a bug.

It may work with other networks.  Users are encouraged to report networks that
it works on and to request support for other networks.

USAGE

Once you have the plugin installed, activate it (Tools -> Plugins).  All of the
options are customized on a per account basis (see Accounts -> [an IRC account]
-> Edit Account -> Advanced).

The plugin suppresses lots of useless messages with no configuration.  However,
a few features require configuration.  The options currently available are:

Auth name:
	Set a username to use when authenticating to AuthServ.

	If an auth name is not set, the account's screen name (i.e. the IRC
	nickname) is used instead.  This is normally what you want anyway.
	This option is only necessary if your nickname and AuthServ username
	differ.

	NOTE: This only applies to networks that use an AuthServ.  It does not
	apply to those using a NickServ, as all currently supported
	implementations of NickServ have no concept of a auth username.

Nick password:
	Set a password to use when authenticating to AuthServ, NickServ or
	Q (for QuakeNet).

	SECURITY NOTE:
		Do not set a nick password on any network (other than those
		listed above as supported networks) that doesn't use NickServ
		for authentication or you could expose your credentials to a
		user impersonating NickServ.

Disconnect ghosts (Duplicate nicknames):
	Disconnect duplicate copies of your nickname.

	Typically, this is used to kill ghosted usernames.  A username is
	referred to as "ghosted" when your connection to the IRC server is
	disconnected, but the server hasn't noticed yet.

	When this option is activated and the plugin notices your username
	immediately after signing on is different than the nickname set on the
	account, it will ask NickServ to kill your (regular) nickname, wait for
	NickServ to report the nickname was killed, and then change your
	nickname to what it should be.

	NOTE:
		This is currently not supported on QuakeNet.  The QuakeNet
		General FAQ (http://quakenet.org/faq/faq.php?c=4&f=8#8) seems
		to imply that the Q bot does not provide the ability to
		disconnect ghosted usernames.

Operator password:
	Set a password to use to become an IRCop.

	This will issue the following IRC command on signon:
		OPER your_nickname specified_password
